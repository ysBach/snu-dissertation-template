Why does this school (SNU) have no official latex template...?? I am stunned to find virtually all PhD-level students in the branches of sciences/engineering are wasting a huge amount of time to find proper templates. What a waste of precious human resources.

I also do not want to spend too much time on genalizing the template, as there's no reasons to make a general "unofficial" template by myself (lack of ability & motivation). The best way is SNU library publishes the official template...
