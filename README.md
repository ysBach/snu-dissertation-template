Why does this school (SNU) have no official latex template...?? I am surprised virtually all PhD-level students in the branches of sciences/engineering are spending huge amount of times to find proper templates for them twice a year. What a waste of precious human resources.

I also do not want to spend too much time on genalizing the template, as there's no reasons to make a general "unofficial" template. The best way is library publishes the official template...
